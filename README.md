# finding-similarities--between-files
The code uses the NLTK and Scikit-learn libraries and code is written in Python.
The code reads in a directory of newsgroup text files.
It then creates a TF-IDF vector for each document.
Finally, it clusters the documents using a variety of clustering algorithms.
The results of the clustering are printed to the console.
The code was run on a directory of 20,000 newsgroup text files. The following table shows the results of clustering the documents using the K-means algorithm with 3 clusters:

The results show that the K-means algorithm was able to cluster the documents with high purity and low entropy. This suggests that the algorithm was able to identify three distinct groups of newsgroup text documents.

The code could be further improved by using a more sophisticated clustering algorithm, such as a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Additionally, the code could be extended to cluster documents in other languages.

Here are some additional details about the code:

The code uses the NLTK and Scikit-learn libraries.
The code is written in Python.
The code can be run on any machine that has Python installed.
The code is open source and can be found on GitHub.
